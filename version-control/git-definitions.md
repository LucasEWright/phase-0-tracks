# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control is a system of branching off a main project that allows someone to work on aspects of that project at the same time.  It's use because it lets you create save points that you can revert to in case of an error, to work with a team on the same porject without stepping on each others toes, and is a history of the project

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch starts as a copy of the master branch that is used to work on a piece of the overall project without effecting the master branch until it is merged.  It reduces the risk of placing bad code in your control branch.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit is when you save your code to the feature branch.  It's like a save point in video games.  A good commit message sucinctly explains the changes you made.

* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict is when your attempting to commit code to the repo but are unable to because you wenen't working off the most current code commited.  Meaning you didn't pull the most current code from the repos before making and attempting to commit your update.
