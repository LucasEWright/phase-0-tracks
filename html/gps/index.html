<!-- What's the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?  The purpose of semantic tags is allow the browser to identify the parts of a page, as a user would.  It gives greater definition to sections (more than that it's a section).  I think I'd find header the most useful.

What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page? HTML is read top to bottom (though I'm not 100% sure I understand the question)


What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?  I learned that you can create snippets, which I will totally use later.  I assume for stuff I use often and for hard to build items that I may use again.

What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept? I think it was how to nest the semantic tags. I'll continue to research those on my own, as I picked up a lot just from the pairing session.
