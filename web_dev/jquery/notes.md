** Plan to learn jquery - 2hrs **

> go through code academy tutorials to build a general knowledge of scope, synax 
> and capabilites. Max 30mins  

> research a few topics pulled from code academy. Max 30mins

> locate and bookmark static resources (cheatsheets, blogs, stellar websites, templates) 45mins

> use pomodoro methods to take breaks.  Test new knowledge when applicable 

===================================
Code academy was very helpful to get an introduction and gave me plenty of rabbit holes.  It wasn't as easy I assumed it would be to find readable resources, but I was able to find a handful of resources that I found helpful.  Putting a time limit on each feature or quirk was helpful to get a broad sense of jquery but not to spend too much time or energy.
